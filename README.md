PageSlider
==========

A simple library providing hardware accelerated page transitions for Mobile Apps

The Library uses hash to navigate between templates. It is best used with some templating engine such as Handlebars, Mustache, Underscore, etc.

This Fork extends the basic PageSlider animations with Animate.css animations.
